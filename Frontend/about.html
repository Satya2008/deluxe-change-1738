			<h2>Project Highlights</h2>
			<h4>1. Online Customer Service Center:</h4>
			<ul>
				The project aims to create an efficient and streamlined online customer
				service center, where customers can reach out with their issues and get
				them resolved effectively.
			</ul>
			<h4>2. One and Done' Approach:-</h4>
			<ul>
				The call center process is optimized to handle as many queries as
				possible in a single interaction, known as the 'one and done' approach.
				This approach reduces the need for transferring calls between operators,
				enhancing overall efficiency.
			</ul>
			<h4>3. Technology Stack:-</h4>
			<ul>
				The application will be developed using Core Java, Spring Boot, Rest
				Controller, JPA with Hibernate. This modern and robust technology stack
				ensures a scalable and maintainable solution.
			</ul>
			<h4>4. Entities and Relationships:-</h4>
			<ul>
				The project defines several entities such as Customer, Login,
				Department, Call, Operator, Issue, and Solution. These entities are
				interconnected to manage the flow of information and ensure smooth
				operations.
			</ul>
			<h4>5. User Authentication and Authorization:-</h4>
			<ul>
				The system implements user authentication through the Login entity. It
				ensures that only authorized personnel have access to specific
				functionalities based on their user type and privileges.
			</ul>
			<h4>6. Customer Management:-</h4>
			<ul>
				The system allows customers to register, login, and manage their profile
				information. It enables password recovery through email and other
				essential customer services.
			</ul>
			<h4>7. Issue Management:-</h4>
			<ul>
				Customers can raise issues through the system. Each issue is recorded
				with relevant details like issue type, description, and status.
				Operators can view, modify, and close customer issues to provide
				effective solutions.
			</ul>
			<h4>8. Department and Operator Management:-</h4>
			<ul>
				Admins have control over department and operator management. They can
				add, remove, modify departments, as well as add, remove, and modify
				operator details. This ensures the right distribution of tasks and
				responsibilities.
			</ul>
			<h4>9. Customer-Operator Communication:-</h4>

				The system provides features to view and manage all issues. It allows
				filtering issues based on various parameters, making it easier for
				operators to handle multiple issues simultaneously.
			</ul>
			<h4>11. Data Persistence:-</h4>
			<ul>
				The project utilizes JPA with Hibernate for data persistence. This
				ensures data integrity, consistency, and easy retrieval of information
				from the database.
			</ul>
			<h4>12. Scalability and Maintainability:-</h4>
			<ul>
				The use of Spring Boot and a well-designed architecture ensures that the
				application is scalable to handle increasing user demands. Additionally,
				the use of modern technologies and best practices ensures ease of
				maintenance and future enhancements.
			</ul>
			<h4>13. User-Friendly Interface:-</h4>
